# warmup-dsa

The goal of this set of drills is to create muscle memory in the core operations that allow me to inspect the data in each data structure.

This is solely to practice iteration and traversals of different data structures. 

## Basics
**Data Structure** - is a collection of values. 

**Algorithms** - are steps/processes to manipulate these values.

**Data Structure + Algorithms = Programs**

**Data structures can affect the process of computers**.

## Instruction: 

Process a Queue and a Stack in the correct order.

Iterate a linked list, printing out the values.

Traverse a Binary Tree, printing out the values as you visit each node.
  - Breath First
  - Depth First: Pre-Order
  - Depth First: In-Order
  - Depth First: Post-Order

Traverse a Graph, printing out the value on each vertex as you visit.
  - Breadth First
  - Depth First

Write QuickSort, MergeSort, InsertionSort functions for an array.
