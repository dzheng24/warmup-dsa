# Stacks and Queues

"Linear Data Structures"

## Stacks (can be implemented using arrays or linked lists)

"LIFO" - Last In First Out, think of them as a stack of plates
- Pop: O(1);
- Push O(1);
- Peek O(1);
- Lookup: O(n);


## Queues (best implemented with linked lists)

"FIFO" - FIFO, First In First Out, think of an entrance to a roller coaster 
- Enqueue: O(1);
- Dequeue: O(1);
- Peek: O(1);
- Lookup: O(n);

## Together
Pros:
  - Fast Operations
  - Fast Peek
  - Ordered

Cons: 
  - Slow Lookup
